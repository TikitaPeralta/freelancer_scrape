# Scraping Freelancer
## Description
This repository contains a gitignore, a CSV file and a python file. 
The purpose of this project was to scrape the site: https://www.freelancer.co.uk/ for data specific to jobs I was interested in. For this CSV file, I focused on python-related jobs.
I wanted to change the layout of the list of jobs, only getting information specific to: date, title, price, description, skills, and url. In the later YouTube video I placed this data into an excel format.
